# EMSai - EDPO Project Group 3

EMSai is an energy management systems provider.
The project was developed as part of the EDPO course at the University of St. Gallen.
Currently the Sales, Inventory and Payment services are implemented, enabeling a client to order a battery for an EMS and have it installed.

## Setup

### Start Vue.js application
To start the vue.js Application, change to folder './frontend-monitoring'.
For running the application run: 

`npm install`

`npm run dev`


To start the application, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` (Camunda Platform) or `docker-compose -f docker-compose-cloud.yml up` (Camunda Cloud) to start the Kafka, Zeebee, Kafdrop, Camunda Tasklist, Elasticsearch, Operate and Zookeeper Containers.

Then start your services individually.
To ensure correct behavior, make sure all the containers are running before starting the services.

## Scenarios

### Happy Path

#### Sales
1. Customer requests a battery via the frontend (localhost:3000/sales)
![offer-request-form.png](doc%2Fimages%2Foffer-request-form.png)
2. Sales service receives the request and starts the sales process
3. Battery size gets calculated
4. Human Task is created in the Tasklist (localhost:8181) to approve the battery size and create the offer
![create-offer-task.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fcreate-offer-task.png)
5. The offer is sent to the customer
   **Output**: Email gets logged in the console of the inventory service with the corresopnding link to the frontend (localhost:3000/sales?id={offerId})
6. Customer accepts the offer
![accept-offer-form.png](doc%2Fimages%2Faccept-offer-form.png)
7. Oder placed event is published

#### Inventory
1. Inventory service receives the order placed event
2. Inventory service starts the inventory process
3. Inventory service checks if the materials are available (hardcoded to false)
4. Components and complementary materials are ordered
![await-parts-operate.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fawait-parts-operate.png)
5. Arrival of the Components and complementary materials is confirmed via the frontend (localhost:3000/inventory?id={orderId}) The orderId needs to be manually copied from the operate and added as the url parameter.
![confirm-parts-form.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fconfirm-parts-form.png)
6. A Human task is created in the Tasklist to assemble the parts
![assemble-parts-task.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fassemble-parts-task.png)
7. A message is sent to the client to fix and appointment for the installation
   **Output**: Email gets logged in the console of the inventory service with the corresopnding link to the frontend (localhost:3000/inventory?id={orderId})
8. The appointment is confirmed via the frontend (localhost:3000/inventory?id={orderId})
![appointment-form.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fappointment-form.png)
9. A human task is created in the Tasklist to install the battery
![installation-task.png](doc%2Fimages%2Finstallation-task.png)
10. Installation confirmed event is published

#### Payment
1. Payment service receives the installation confirmed event
2. Payment service starts the payment process
3. The Invoice is sent to the customer
   **Output**: Email gets logged in the console of the payment service.
4. A reminder is sent to the customer
   **Output**: Email gets logged in the console of the payment service.
5. The payment is confirmed via the frontend (localhost:3000/payment) The invoiceId needs to be manually copied from the operate and added to the form to mark the invoice as paid.
![payment-operate.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fpayment-operate.png)
![confirm-invoice-form.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fconfirm-invoice-form.png)
6. The payment is confirmed via the ERP system

### Alternative Paths

#### Sales - battery calculation error
1. Customer requests a battery via the frontend (localhost:3000/sales
![request-offer-form_error.png](doc%2Fimages%2Frequest-offer-form_error.png)
2. Sales service receives the request and starts the sales process
3. Battery size gets calculated
4. An error occurs in the calculation (for demo purposes the error can be triggered by entering a negative number in the frontend)
   **Output**: Error message gets logged in the console of the sales service.
![calculation-error-operate.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fcalculation-error-operate.png)
5. A human task is created in the Tasklist to fix the error and manually calculate the battery size
6. Flow continues as in the happy path
